## Novembers are always very hectic, this time more so 

Novembers are usually very hectic, with a lot of birthdays, weddings and the festive seasons all rolled in one. 2021 was no different, very hectic with a lot of travel, family and trainings all mixed together. November saw Diwali, moving back to Gurgaon, weddings of 2 close friends some travel to Punjab and Delhi, all in anticipation of the crazy wedding week that was to follow in December. 

### Recapping November 2021

First part of the month saw the continuation of my depressive episode until Diwali/Bhai Dooj when I had an open conversation with my parents sharing that I am not mentally healthy. It was helpful to a certain extent, they gave me some more breathing space which was nice, I don't think they fully comprehend what I shared with them. Also made me actually wonder how little do my parents actually know me, for example - my parents think I am overconfident/cocky in my abilities, and am the most positive/ cheerful person, which couldn't possibly any further away from truth :P. Moving on I did manage to get back on track by the mid of the month, when I had to travel to Delhi on consecutive weekends to househunt, attend weddings etc. I travelled to Phillaur and Hoshiarpur too during this time to check up on Nanima and attend Angad's wedding. The week post that saw me in ~12 hour daily trainings. The weekend post that also saw me attend the team offsite, which happened in Manesar, that was fun. In all a lot of shit was happening in November, maybe the reason i got out of the rut was that I had not time to think/ talk / feel sad.


#### Personal Development

I got back to listening to audiobooks, enrolled myself in multiple courses, however not too much was accomplished because well, no time you see.

* **Rust** - Took up learning a new programming language - Rust did some intital lessons, but no headway here
*  **Blender** - Signed up for a course on Blender. My eventual goal is to mint some NFTs for myself based on blender
*  **Screen writing** - An impulse purchase but I am planning to see what Varun Grover has to teach about script writing/ poetry etc. Maybe would help me craft better story lines for my comic strip/ graphic novel

#### Other interests
* Nothing of note here. Did watch a lot of TV/ Movies etc


#### Books/ Audiobooks/ Podcasts
* Homo Deus - Finished
* **Skin in the Game** by Nasim Nicholas Taleb - Started listening to this gem by one of my favorite authors to date, this book is very mind opening, helps you think in newer ways

#### Excercise/ Workout

* Zero

#### Projects

* Project Gecco - Zero
* Project McDuck - Started selling weekly iron condors with adjustments to make consistent weekly profits, until the last week monthly expiry where i blew up all the cumulative profits and some more. Must stop doing YOLO trades.
